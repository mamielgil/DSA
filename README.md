# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository serves as a guide for the study of data structures and algorithms.

There are **two main folders of interest**:

1. Theory: includes the Algorithms and Data Structures that are needed to solve problems.

2. Leetcode: contains my proposed answers for the Leetcode problems and their time and space complexity analysis.
